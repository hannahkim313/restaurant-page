# Restaurant Page

## Project Summary

This project exercise, created by The Odin Project, is a sample restaurant page
for an imaginary brunch establishment.

## Future Updates

As I continue to learn more about and practice using webpack, I plan to revisit
this project and implement the following to improve performance:

* **Code-splitting**

    Currently, some of the fonts are producing asset size limit warning errors
    when running webpack. One of the ways to reduce file size and optimize web
    performance is through code-splitting. Once I learn about promises, I plan
    to go back and implement code-splitting to create dynamic imports.

## Goals

* Use DOM manipulation to dynamically render a webpage
* Gain a greater understanding of npm by installing packages
* Organize code using modules
* Gain a greater understanding of webpack by loading assets and managing
output
