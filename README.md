# Restaurant Page
https://hannahkim313.github.io/restaurant-page/

## Project Summary
This project exercise, created by The Odin Project, is a sample restaurant page
for *Stacks,* an imaginary brunch establishment. This project demonstrates the use
of webpack and ES6 modules combined with a heavy emphasis on DOM manipulation.

## In Action

### Features Overview
<img src="./src/gif/demo.gif" width="auto" height="auto"/>

## Future Updates

### Code-splitting
Currently, some of the fonts are producing asset size limit warning errors
when running webpack. One of the ways to reduce file size and optimize web
performance is through code-splitting. Once I learn about promises, I will go
back and implement code-splitting to create dynamic imports and improve performance.

### Responsiveness
This project is currently **not** responsive to smaller screens. In the future,
I plan to include media queries and/or come up with a friendlier design.

## Goals
* Use DOM manipulation to dynamically render a webpage
* Gain a greater understanding of npm by installing packages
* Organize code using modules
* Gain a greater understanding of webpack by loading assets and managing
output

## Reflection
This is my first time using webpack, and one of my favorite aspects about it is
organizing my code into modules and having it all bundled for output. Separating
my code into different groups made the development progress much easier as I 
could easily keep track of specific elements, functions, and bugs. Besides webpack, 
I had even more fun designing the web page itself. Researching restaurant website
designs and looking at a few local ones helped inspire me to create a something a 
real-life establishment would consider using. I tried to incorporate as many CSS
techniques taught by the curriculum so far as well as some simple animations from
my own research, but I will definitely add more in the future. I am also interested
in experimenting with some of webpack's other features such as code-splitting, 
but that will come in time as I learn about promises.
